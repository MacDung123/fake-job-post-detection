## Introduction
In today's digital age, job seekers are increasingly vulnerable to fake job postings that aim to deceive and exploit them. This project seeks to address this issue by developing a machine learning model that can distinguish between legitimate and fake job posts. By analyzing various features of job advertisements and utilizing advanced algorithms, this model can help job seekers identify potential scams and protect themselves from fraudulent activities.

## Features
- Data Analysis: The project employs data analysis techniques to extract relevant insights from job postings and identify patterns that indicate fraudulent behavior.
- Deep Learning: Deep learning algorithms are utilized to create a robust model that can accurately classify job posts as fake or legitimate.
- NLP Machine Learning: Natural Language Processing techniques are applied to process and analyze textual information from job advertisements.
- Python Libraries: The project makes use of popular Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Joblib for data manipulation, machine learning, and model persistence.
- GUI Interface: A graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter is developed to provide a user-friendly experience for interacting with the fake job post detection system.
